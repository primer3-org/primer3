   Press).

   Tm = 81.5 + 16.6(log10([Na+])) + .41*(%GC) - 600/length

   Where [Na+] is the molar sodium concentration, (%GC) is the percent of Gs
   and Cs in the sequence, and length is the length of the sequence.

   A similar formula is used by the prime primer selection program in GCG
   (http://www.gcg.com), which instead uses 675.0 / length in the last term
   (after F. Baldino, Jr, M.-F. Chesselet, and M.E.  Lewis, Methods in
   Enzymology 168:766 (1989) eqn (1) on page 766 without the mismatch and
   formamide terms).  The formulas here and in Baldino et al. assume Na+ rather
   than K+.  According to J.G. Wetmur, Critical Reviews in BioChem. and
   Mol. Bio. 26:227 (1991) 50 mM K+ should be equivalent in these formulae to .2
   M Na+.

   This function takes salt_conc to be the millimolar (mM) concentration,
   since mM is the usual units in PCR applications.

   Both functions return the melting temperature of the given oligo

   DNA sequences of length <= MAX_PRIMER_LENGTH (which is defined
   elsewhere).  seqtm uses oligotm for sequences of length <=
   MAX_PRIMER_LENGTH, and a different, G+C% based formula for longer
   sequences.  For oligotm(), no error is generated on sequences
   longer than MAX_PRIMER_LENGTH, but the formula becomes less
   accurate as the sequence grows longer.  Caveat emptor.
